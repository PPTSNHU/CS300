•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout this course I learned how to store data in specific containers or data structures and use patterned algorithms to sort, insert, edit, and delete data from the structures. Three major methods of storing and sorting were vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. All having advantages and disadvantages that coincide with their application in storing and sorting data.

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Most of this material was a new world for me and took a lot of practice and time to grasp, or should I say almost grasp. I understand the logic when discussing data and how these structures apply to analyzing it but when I write the code in C++ I get lost in the pointer structures of more complex containers. These structures are crucial to storing and understanding data and utilizing data efficiently. Runtime analysis we applied to our algorithms show us the complete comparison between theses in terms of processor work or memory storage which is crucial in development of any system.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Practice makes perfect, and utilizing tools like YouTube, Stack Overflow, My professor’s extended resources offered outside of assigned coursework, Google, and the SNHU online tutors to name a few of the many sources I used to find information on building and understanding the assignments throughout this course. I am beginning to grasp the effectiveness of pointers as a tool in the scripting environment now as well. I hope to eventually be vastly more proficient at using them in from coding toolbelt.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Firstly, as stated in the last response, my understanding of pointers and their capabilities became clearer to me in this course. They were heavily applied to various assignments I worked on and broaden my knowledge base in their application in programming. I also now understand more how to contain data in ways that are beneficial to the overall performance of systems I will have a hand in designing in the future. I don’t feel completely confident in what I can apply in terms of what I learned although in time I will progress and see myself writing more complex code with ease from learning the techniques in this course. 

Danke Professor!

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I generally feel I have a better understanding of basic concepts in coding with C++, and want to apply them to future learning. The arch I took personally in completing my assignments in this class has piqued my interest further in developing my coding abilities and learning more until I can say I am a coder, as opposed to I am learning to code. In time, with lots of practice, I will get there and with this course experience I am more very motivated to grow.
